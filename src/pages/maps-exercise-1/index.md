In this exercise, we will explore the **MAPS interface** so that we are comfortable navigating the website to find what we need.

Here are some links to useful Esri documentation as we go through this section. Remember that these documentation pages are generic to **ArcGIS Enterprise**.

- [Use Search](http://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/10.5/use/search.htm)

## MAPS Homepage

1. Navigate to the [MAPS Homepage](https://metlifeag-stage.esriemcs.com).

    You can think of this as the landing page for all things MAPS and Plat Builder. If you're going to bookmark only one page - this is it!

    From here, you can launch **Plat Builder** and **REIOS**. It is worth noting that you can launch the **My Stories** page from here as well -- for now know that this is an advanced feature, and isn't necessary for platting (but might be fun to explore another time).

2. Click **Sign In** and enter your MAPS username and password.

    You will see the homepage again, but this time notice the new links in the navigation bar at the top of the page. You are now logged in to MAPS!

## User Profile Settings

1. Click your username at the top of the page, then click **My Profile**.

    You are now on your **User Profile** page. From here you can edit your profile.

2. Click **Edit Profile**, then **click the blank thumbnail picture** and upload a photo (it doesn't have to be you if you'd prefer not to, but having something here helps with recognition as other users are interacting with the things you'll create).

    ⚠️  If you'd prefer to leave the photo blank -- thats ok too.

3. Verify the rest of your information is correct.

    If you'd like to enter a security question/answer (in case you forget your password), go ahead and do that now.

4. When you're happy with your profile settings, click **Save**.

## My Content

The **My Content** page is where you will manage all the content you will create in MAPS. Think of it like a file explorer, but a little more simple - only one level of folders is allowed.

1. Click **My Content** in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

    When you first come to the **My Content** page, you will see your **Home folder**. If you've gone through the **Plat Builder Exercises**, you should see some additional folders listed on the left of the page.

    ℹ️  The content created as part of a **Plat Package** is always placed into a folder that is prefixed with "Plat" followed by the name of the package.

2. If you have a "Plat-" folder, click it to view its contents.

    If you've gone through the Plat Builder Exercises, you'll remember that **Plat Packages are made up of three items -- a webmap, a storymap, and a feature layer**. You should see those three items in your "Plat-" folder now.

    ℹ️  Note that there are some cases where a Plat Package *does not include a feature layer*, so if you don't see one, don't worry!

3. Take a look at each of the items in this folder, you can see the **Title**, **Type**, **Modified**, and **Shared** properties of each item. These properties may come in handy if you are troubleshooting an issue with your package.

## Search

Now that we're familiar with **My Content**, let's see how we can discover **content published by other people**.

⚠️  Remember that if you are simply searching for a Plat Package, you should do that from the **Plat Builder dashboard**. The **MAPS Search** is helpful when you need to find the underlying items that make up a package.

We can search for content from any page by typing into the **Search** in the top right corner of the page.

1. Click in the **Search** and type **Holly Bluff**.

    ⚠️ A fake Plat Package named Holly Bluff was created for this workshop -- if you're going through this exercise at a later date, its possible it doesn't exist anymore. In that case just search for a package name you created during the **Plat Builder Exercises**.

    The **Search Results** page includes a list of your results along with a few handy ways to sort and filter them. Since this is a more advanced workflow, we won't spend time going through all these options now, but feel free to poke around on this page for a bit if you're interested.

## Wrapping it up

This exercise was pretty loose, and was meant to show you around the MAPS Interface so you feel more comfortable finding what you need, when you need it. Remember that most of the pages we discovered during this exercise are not necessary when you're platting, but come in very handy when you need to do something advanced or are troubleshooting an issue.
