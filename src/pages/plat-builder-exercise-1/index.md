In this exercise, we will **Create a basic Plat Package** so that we can understand how the basic workflow and tools are used.

## Start a new Plat Package

1. Open **Plat Builder**.

2. Click **Create New Plat**.  

## Add Tracts to your Plat Package

1. Click **Search Tracts**.

2. Find loan **192802 - Central States**, managed by Bradley Hibbert.  

    Try finding this loan using a few different methods, for example:

    - Use the Investment Manager dropdown to select **Bradley Hibbert** (you can jump to D by hitting the D key after you have opened the list).

    - Type the **Loan ID** (192802) or **Loan Name** (Central States) into the search input.

3. Click on the loan and add all tracts in the loan to your Plat Package. Notice that each of these tracts already have boundaries -- this means someone has previously worked with these tracts.  

    - You can add the three tracts individually, or by clicking **Add All to Package** on the loan itself.

    - If you're interested in learning more about these tracts, you can click the tract number to view it in REIOS.

4. Dismiss the Loan Search dialog, then click **All Tracts** (next to the search input).  

    - You should now see the tracts in your Tract List (on the left sidebar), as well as on the map. You can learn more about each tract by clicking the boundary on the map.

5. When you're happy with your **Tracts**, click **Continue** to move to the next step.

## Choose Sections for your Plat Package

*Notice the wizard at the top of the page now shows step 1 ("Tracts") as complete, and you are now on step 2 ("Data Sections"). You can always see your progress by checking this wizard, and you can move back to previous steps by clicking that step's name in the wizard.*

1. The left sidebar now displays Data Sections, and allows us to choose the sections we would like to include in this Plat Package. Notice that **Plat Package Overview** is not removable -- this is a required section for all Plat Packages. The other default section is the **Property Overview**, but this section is not required, and could be removed if desired. We'll keep it for now, and we'll add a few more sections: click **Add Another Section**.

2. You should now see the 6 additional sections which can be included in a Plat Package. Click the following sections to add them to your Plat Package:

    - Soils
    - Topography
    - Flood

3. Click **Done Adding Sections** to return to the list of sections you've chosen to include in this Plat Package.

4. When you're happy with your **Data Sections**, click **Continue** to move to the next step.

## Additional Configuration

*This section allows us to enable additional "layers" for data collection. We'll choose any __Editable Layers__ we'd like someone to be able to add features to.*

1. Using the checkboxes, choose the following **Editable Layers**:

    - Buildings
    - Fuel Tanks
    - Wells

4. When you're happy with your **Editable Layers**, click **Continue** to move to the next step.

## Review and Submit your Plat Package

*This section provides us with a chance to review our Plat Package before submitting it. We can see the boundaries on the map along with the __Tracts__, __Data Sections__, and __Editable Layers__ we've chosen to include.*

1. In the **Name and Finalize** section on the right sidebar, enter a **Plat Package Title** and **Description**.

2. Using the checkboxes in the **Name and Finalize** section, choose **Agribusiness** and **Loan Management Group (LMG)**

    - Note that the options for sharing can change based on how your MAPS user account has been configured. If you don't see the options listed above, you can choose others for now.

3. When you're happy with your **Plat Package**, click **Submit Plat Package**.

    - ⚠️ This step **cannot be undone**, and once you've submitted your Plat Package, certain things are no longer editable. Later, we will discuss what can and cannot be changed after this step.

4. Once the Plat Package has been built, click **View Plat Package** to see what you've created!

## That's it!

This is the end of this exercise. We used the most basic tools to create a **Plat Package**, and didn't dive into any advanced workflows yet. Hopefully this gave you a chance to understand the **workflow** and get more comfortable clicking around **Plat Builder**. In the next exercises we'll get into more advanced concepts.
