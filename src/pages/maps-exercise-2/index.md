In this exercise, we will explore the editing tools available in the **Story Map Journal Builder** so that we know how to apply **finishing** touches to our Plat Packages.

## Opening a Plat Package for editing

There are two ways to open a Plat Package (specifically the **Story Map Journal**) for **finishing**.

#### From Plat Builder

The primary way to open the Plat Package for **finishing** is from the Plat Builder dashboard.

1. Navigate to the **Plat Builder homepage** and click the package you want to finish.

2. On the package details page, click the dropdown arrow next to **View Plat Package** and click **Edit Plat Package**.

    - Note that you can also click **View Plat Package**, then switch to edit mode once you're there.

#### From MAPS - My Content

When you are **finishing** a Plat Package, you are editing the underlying **Story Map Journal**. Story Map Journals are a type of **Web Mapping Application** in MAPS. Knowing that, it shouldn't surprise you that you can also access that item from the **My Content** page in MAPS!

1. Navigate to the My Content page.

2. Open the folder that corresponds to the Plat Package you wish to finish.

4. Click on the **Web Mapping Application**. It should have **Storymap** at the end of the name.

    This will take you to the **Item Details page**.

5. Click **Configure App** to begin editing the item.

Whichever of these two methods you choose -- the end result should be the same. You should now have your Plat Package open in edit mode.

## Editing the Plat Package

Now that we have our Plat Package open for editing, there are quite a lot of tools at our disposal. Plat Builder has done the vast majority of the work for us -- building the content (on the left side of the page) and maps (on the right side) that make up our package.

We'll only cover the basic workflow to **finish** a Plat Package in this exercise, but if you're interested in the other **finishing options**, you should check out the links at the end of this section.

1. In the **Package Overview** section, click the **pencil icon** between the content area and the map.

2. Replace the "..." after **Related Loans** with any related loans. If there are none, replace it with "N/A".

3. If you have any **notes that apply to the package as a whole**, you can enter them after the tracts table in this section. There are also placeholders for notes in some of the individual sections.

4. Scroll down (or click the down arrow on the left side of the app) to move to the **Property Overview** section.

5. Click the **pencil icon** between the content area and the map.

6. Replace the "Add custom content here!" text inside the box with your notes for this tract. If you don't wish to includes notes, you can simply delete the box and the "More Notes:" label.

7. Continue through your package, making notes on subsequent sections as needed.

8. When you're happy with your changes, click **Save** in the top right corner of the page.

## Remember...

It is **very important to remember that edits made while finishing will be overwritten if you Refresh this Plat Package!**. This is necessary since Plat Builder reinserts REIOS data when you request a refresh of a package. This is why we refer to the types of edits made in this exercise as **finishing**.
