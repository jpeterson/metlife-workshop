In this exercise, we will explore the **MAPS interface** so that we are comfortable navigating the website to find what we need.

## MAPS Homepage

1. Navigate to the [MAPS Homepage](https://metlifeag-stage.esriemcs.com).

    You can think of this as the landing page for all things MAPS and Plat Builder. If you're going to bookmark only one page - this is it!

    From here, you can launch **Plat Builder** and **REIOS**. It is worth noting that you can launch the **My Stories** page from here as well -- for now know that this is an advanced feature, and isn't necessary for platting (but might be fun to explore another time).

2. Click **Sign In** and enter your MAPS username and password.

    You will see the homepage again, but this time notice the new links in the navigation bar at the top of the page. You are now logged in to MAPS!

## User Profile Settings

1. Click your username at the top of the page, then click **My Profile**.

    You are now on your **User Profile** page. From here you can edit your profile.

2. Click **Edit Profile**, then **click the blank thumbnail picture** and upload a photo (it doesn't have to be you if you'd prefer not to, but having something here helps with recognition as other users are interacting with the things you'll create).

    ⚠️  If you'd prefer to leave the photo blank -- thats ok too.

3. Verify the rest of your information is correct.

    If you'd like to enter a security question/answer (in case you forget your password), go ahead and do that now.

4. When you're happy with your profile settings, click **Save**.

## My Content

The **My Content** page is where you will manage all the content you will create in MAPS. Think of it like a file explorer, but a little more simple - only one level of folders is allowed.

1. Click **My Content** in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

    When you first come to the **My Content** page, you will see your **Home folder**. If you've gone through the **Plat Builder Exercises**, you should see some additional folders listed on the left of the page.

    ℹ️  The content created as part of a **Plat Package** is always placed into a folder that is prefixed with "Plat" followed by the name of the package.

2. If you have a "Plat-" folder, click it to view its contents.

    If you've gone through the Plat Builder Exercises, you'll remember that **Plat Packages are made up of three items -- a webmap, a storymap, and a feature layer**. You should see those three items in your "Plat-" folder now.

    ℹ️  Note that there are some cases where a Plat Package *does not include a feature layer*, so if you don't see one, don't worry!
